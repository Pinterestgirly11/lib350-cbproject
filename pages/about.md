## project description

The theme of our collection is centered around Anti and Pro tobacco campaigns in the U.S during the 1960s. The significance in our topic compares and contrasts the images of Advertisements that can promote and detest the idea of smoking cigarettes. During further research, it was dated that during the 1940s-50s tobacco had been identified as cancerous for the sake of your lungs, so we want to encapsulate through a decade of tension to either buy or quit. I believe that medical practitioners, new millennial, advertisers, students and lastly cigarette smokers will find this collection interesting because our audience is intended for those who are engaged or interested in the effects of cigarettes in the 1960s. Our audience could put our collection to use through research about cancer, and learn the controversy of tobacco. 

In today's day and age people have engaged with e-cigarettes and vaporized tobacco that is twice as harmful. This collection will provide knowledge about the contradiction between the campaigns.
 I do hope that our collection will show that we are not promoting the use of tobacco but to provide insight about how the economy works in the U.S. For example, products sold to U.S Citizens in stores are often bad for our health but no one actually reads the nutritional facts; we hope to provide the facts through images and highlighting both sides of tobacco. The contents of the collection involve titles that describe the message of the advertisement, The ad campaigns vary from illustrations, Human models/actors, and compelling word use. Our team was able to find archives from the stanford collection, the national library and more. We were even lucky enough to discover the originator of the campaign for more insight and the sake of our research.
