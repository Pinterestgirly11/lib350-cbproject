**Advertisements & Campaigns of Tobacco Use- A collection showcasing advertisements from the 1960s that either encourage or discourage tobacco use** 

**Data Management Plan**

**Project Description**

This project required us to build a website that showcases a curated digital collection using pre-existing online archives centered around a specific theme. We were instructed to accumulate a minimum of 20 digital objects, and document all of their respective data into a master spreadsheet using a template from CollectionBuilder,  making sure to be careful of each object’s copyright status. CollectionBuilder is a program used for creating digital collections and exhibit websites. The metadata was then uploaded into GitHub, which was used along with CollectionBuilder to create our website.  The topic of this project centers around advertisements that are either pro or anti tobacco use from the 1960s. In the United States, the 1960s is when the government began its campaign against tobacco use. It was a time when conflicting advertisements were prevalent, and even tough to decipher which was which in certain cases. 

**Roles and Responsibilities**

Since there are two members of this group, the responsibilities were evenly split between the two. Each person put time into researching and selecting meaningful and relevant objects, documenting their data, building and customizing the github site, and working together to smooth out any issues along the way. 

**Anticipated Data**

Our data was collected by browsing several different online digital collections from museums, universities, and other online archives. We used keywords such as “smoking advertisements,” “anti tobacco,” and “cigarettes,” to help narrow down our search, as well as filter out our specific date range. Data includes things such as urls to each object’s original location, the author’s information, the type of file, the file name, the date of each object’s creation, and so forth.

**Documentation and Metadata** 

Users are able to access metadata through several routes. The first, is by clicking on any object and locating all its information listed underneath, as well as clicking on the link provided to where the original digitized documentation exists on the web. The other is by locating our page titled “DMP,” where an extensive data dictionary exists, along with other information about our project. 

**Storage and Backup** 

Our metadata is stored on a master spreadsheet on Google Sheets, as well as stored, along with each image file, on a Google Drive folder. It has also been uploaded to our GitHub repository. As a backup, we have copies of our spreadsheet as well as each image saved to a personal laptop. 

**Data Sharing** 

All of our data recorded on our original spreadsheet has been made fully accessible and shared with others through this data management plan. Our data can be reused by others in almost any manner, seeing that it follows the copyright laws of each object in our collection. The data dictionary is helpful when reusing data because it organizes the objectid, filename, title, date, creator etc.). This is important because our audience has information they need and do not have to prioritize the research due to the investment of time it requires when collecting data. 

**Period of Data Retention** 

Following the end of this course and with it, this very project, we plan on leaving our webpage up, as is. We do not plan on maintaining it or updating it after the course ends. We recognize that there may be flaws in our work and things we could have improved, but we believe in keeping intact all of our original intentions and progress as a way to look back on our work. We are proud of our end result. After submission there will be a full review of our project and then stored separately for our credibility with digital humanities for our future in this field.  

**Licensing and Ethical Issues** 

While recording our metadata, we made sure to best include the correct and accurate copyright laws for each object. While most ended up being fair use (and a few miscellaneous), there were a good few that had undetermined or unknown copyright assigned to it. We used our discretion and made an executive decision whether or not to include items like this. That being said, it may be up for debate whether or not it would be ethical to use items with unknown copyright. Our metadata includes the copyright information for each object that the user may locate and click a link to read more about it.
