description: "The theme of our collection is centered around Anti and Pro tobacco campaigns in the U.S during the
1960s. The significance in our topic compares and contrasts the images of Advertisements that can
promote and detest the idea of smoking cigarettes. During further research, it was dated that during the
1940s-50s tobacco had been identified as cancerous for the sake of your lungs, so we want to encapsulate
through a decade of tension to either buy or quit. We believe that medical practitioners, new millennial,
advertisers, students and lastly cigarette smokers will find this collection interesting because our audience
is intended for those who are engaged or interested in the effects of cigarettes in the 1960s.
